        <p>
            Hi, my name is Jade and I am a Computer Science student studying at the University of Witswatersrand.
            I am 21 years old, born on the 28th of November 2003 therefore this makes me a sagittarius.
            This is currently my third and final year of study for my undergrad degree. I have a horse stabled at Cedar Ridge Stables.
            Her name is Nena's Star and she is a 6 year old off the track thoroughbred.
        </p>

                I have recently made a few websites for various people. One being the stable that I ride at, Cedar Ridge. 
                On the home page, it cycles through various pictures of the yard on a 5 second interval. 
                The contact page links to both the facebook and instagram. There is also an additional page with photos of various horses.
                Each horse has their name next to them.
